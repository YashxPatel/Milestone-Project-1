## Deliverables

We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term **[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP)** -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.
>
> _Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as **Post-MVP Ideas**. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!_
>
> For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.

### MVP Criteria

- Player has to move when arrow keys are presed or space bar.
- Character should identyfi the obstacle in front of the way.
- Another thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard is if the chracter hit the obstacle it should go back to the starting point of the game.
- The game should also give option to player if they want to keep playing or quit.
- Etc.

### Post-MVP Plans

- Player can change the background of the game or the appearance of the character.
