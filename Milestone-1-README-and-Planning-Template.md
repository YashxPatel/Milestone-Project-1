# NYU-SD-01 Milestone Project: Planning

_Before you start programming your project_... plan it!

Complete the planning sections below and include them in the README.md of your project repository. Once you're done, reach out to your instructional staff -- they'll examine your plan, help you scope it appropriately for the tools available to you and think ahead toward technical solutions, and point out any areas that could use any more thought. _Use the template below!_

## Project Description

_(Replace this text with a brief description of your game and what inspired you to make it.)_

## Game Logic

```
Replace this text with pseudocode.
The pseudocode should describe in plain, simple language the logic of the game.
Describe the logic involved in player decisions.
  - What are the choices available to the player?
  - What happens when the player makes a choice?
Describe the logic that evaluates the player's victory/loss/progress status.
```

## Deliverables

> Even if you have a great big idea for a game, it's important to scope this project according to what you can get done in the next two weeks. We'll refer to your project completion goal using the term **[Minimum Viable Product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) (MVP)** -- a list of the criteria needed to "ship" a playable version of your game that meets the project requirements.
>
> _Don't lose sight of your big ideas, though! Keep a list of further improvements you can refer to as **Post-MVP Ideas**. You might finish some before our project time is done, or you might work on them later!_
>
> For your README, delete this blockquote and fill in the lists below.

### MVP Criteria

- Your game must be winnable and clearly shows thereâ€™s a winner.
- You must provide clear, easily accessible instructions on how to play the game.
- Another thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard.
- One more thing.
- Etc.

### Post-MVP Plans

- One great idea I hope to be able to add in before the project deadline.
- Another that will be a stretch.
- Something else I don't technically know how to do... _yet_. :)
