# Milestone-Project-1

## Project Description

The web game i am going to develope will be character control game, easy to play, Start of the game a player will be using his arrow keys to control the character in game. The main objective of the game is the lead the character to the end point by avoiding hurdels along the way. and if the character get contact with any obstackels the game will be over right their, and player has restart the game from beging.


## Game Logic

```
Player will start the game by clicking any of the arrow keys or space bar 
    - The character will perform the perticular move in response to the which ever the key is presed 
    - Player has to keep presing the arrow key to move character, or press space bar to make the character jump 
    - If the chracter get colided with obstacle the game will stop, and will be redirected to start point again.
    - Player will have 

```

### MVP Criteria

- Player has to move when arrow keys are presed or space bar.
- Character should identyfi the obstacle in front of the way.
- Another thing my game must do to meet my minimum standard is if the chracter hit the obstacle it should go back to the starting point of the game.
- The game should also give option to player if they want to keep playing or quit.
- Etc.

### Post-MVP Plans

- Player can change the background of the game or the appearance of the character.
- Game should be able to increasing the spped of obstacle apearing.

1. What’s your status on your project today?
-  Planing and setting timeline for all the goals.

2. What are you going to do next?
-  Start gathering assets for the build.

3. Explain using code terminology what you’re doing as much as possible
-  The game character will be able to detect colison for the obstcle appearing in front of it,
   In the post MVP the game will increase the speed of making obstacle appear quicker.

4. What is standing in your way? (blockers)
-  I belive their will be only one and that is, how to detect colison.

5. What solution do you need for your blocker(s)?
-  Maybe a reference to a document which might help me with the blocker(s)
